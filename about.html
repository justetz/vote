      In my tenure as a 2018 Class Senator, I have served on a number of student
      government committees to help improve the daily lives of students. I always
      take my constituents' feedback into account, and do the best I can to represent
      the Class of 2018's views as effectively as possible. As always, if you have
      any ideas, concerns, or suggestions that you want me to bring before the Senate,
      feel free to email me!

      As chairman of the Web Technologies Group, I work hard to continue
      and expand upon the committee's mission of creating technological services
      that benefit RPI students. I was involved in the planning and development
      of the new <a class="red" href="http://elections.union.rpi.edu/">elections
      website</a>, which will empower voters to learn more about the candidates
      and be able to make educated decisions when voting.

      As an active member of the Student Life Committee, I believe that it is the
      Senate's responsibility to ensure in every way it can that students' have the
      resources for the best student experience possible. I've participated in writing
      two SLC proposals while serving on the committee. The first, the Residence Hall
      Improvement Recommendations Proposal, was used as a guide for the recent hall
      renovations. Once submitted, the second, the Residence Hall Access Proposal,
      will address student concerns regarding recent changes to the residence halls.

      Aside from student government, I love being involved on campus. I’m
      involved in <i>The Polytechnic</i>, RPI TV, RCOS, Upsilon Pi Epsilon, and
      Chabad. I’m currently studying Computer Science and Information Technology &amp;
      Web Science, and my favorite aspect of the field is the application of what
      we're learning to real-world project development. I love video games and
      a good game of tennis, but don’t expect me to win!

      There are very few things that I love more than his beloved home: RPI. When I’m not working on schoolwork or contributing time to the Senate, you can find me exploring the mysteries of life in the Union. Also, since I come from Florida, I’m more than happy to help anyone adjust to Troy weather from warmer climates.
