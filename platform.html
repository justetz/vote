    <p>As a senator, I pledge to embody the following creed throughout my term:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        I will sit down with my constituents, and I will stand up for my
        constituents.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Be it trivial or earth-shattering, I will address every student concern
      brought to my attention with tact and dedication.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>I will sit down with you.</strong> I want to hear your opinions on issues that
      affect you. I want to know your take on every situation. I want to know
      if I am missing anything; no one person can fully understand the entire
      scope of any project. I want to bring <em>your</em> views to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>I will stand up for you.</strong> I will bring your ideas to Senate and committee
      meetings and relay them to project leaders. I will address your concerns with
      relevant RPI officials to assist in a resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      That promise to each and every one of my constituents is already in effect.
      As always, <a href="mailto:me@justinforsenate.com">you can reach me for any reason</a>.</p>
